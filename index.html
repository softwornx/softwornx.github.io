    <h1><b>THE MOTHERBOARD</b></h1>
    <h2>Introduction of the motherboard</h2>
    <div>
<p>The components inside a computer need to be able to talk to each other.  A motherboard electronic circuit board in a computer which interconnects the hardware that’s attached to it. At a minimum it connects a CPU; busses process destination for data, so the CPU can be left to what it
does best. 
A motherboard normally has a set of expansion slots, which allow the motherboard to be expanded; it can be given extra functionality that it didn’t have originally. Smaller board called cards fit in these expansion slots, and have a series of socket, I/O, Allowing communication through cables with various peripheral device, both inside and outside the computer case. 
Expansion slots
These are connectors on a motherboard where a circuit board can be inserted to add new capabilities All personal computer contains expansion slots for adding more RAM, 
graphics capabilities, and support for special devices; some are more specialized than others.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Graphics card are also called video cards or sometimes video adapters. They 
    are in most PCs. Graphics card convert data signals into video so the 
    images can be displayed on the monitor. While graphics processors are often built into a motherboard and a card isn’t needed, graphics card have 
    Stronger and more powerful processing capabilities that allow the display of 
    3d images, heavy image editing, or better rendering and frame rates in computer games.
    Graphics card are designed to offload the burden of making images from the CPU. Graphics card also Include on board memory for efficient rendering. Typical sizes include 128-1024mb of memory. Today high-end graphics card have multiple core processors that are largely parallel to increase texture fill and process more 3D objects in real time.</p>

    <li>Sound card</li> 
    <div class="image-pictures">
        <img src="/images/sound-card.jpg" alt="Sound card photo">
    </div>
    <p>A sound card, also referred to as an audio card, allows the input and output of audio signals to and from a computer under the control of computer programs. 
    Sound card for computer were unusual to find until 1988, the single internet pc speaker was the only way early pc software could produce sound and music. 
    Uses of sound card include the audio components for multimedia application such as games, 
    video/audio editing software and music components. most computers today have sound capabilities built into the motherboard,
    while other require additional expansion card.</p>

    <li>Network interface cards (NICs)</li>
    <div class="image-pictures">
        <img src="/images/Network_card.jpg" alt="Network card photo">
    </div>
    <p>A comparison of pc cards and Express cards 
    A network interface card can be network card, network adapter, LAN Adapter or 
    Nic (network interface card). They are piece of computer hardware designed to allow computer to communicate over computer network.
    Pc card
    A pc card (originally PCMCIA card) is any Card, like a graphics or network card, designed for laptop computer. Laptops have a different style of expansion slot called a PCMCIA slot. Pc cards are being phased out, and are usually only found on older laptops.
    Express card 
    Express cards are replacing pc cards in modern computer because of their smaller size. </p>

    <li>Port</li>
    <div class="image-pictures">
        
    </div>
    <p> are used by motherboard to interface with electronic; a way of getting input and output to and from hardware. 
    Ports are commonly used to attach peripherals, specifically, hardware that exists outside the computer’s case, 
    although some ports connect to things inside the computer too. The amount of data that can be transferred over ports during a giving amount of time is 
    its bandwidth.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <li>	USB</li>
    <div class="image-pictures">
        <img src="/images/usb.jpg" alt="usb photo">
    </div>
    <p>USB is an acronym for universal serial bus. USB was designed to standardize the connection of computer peripheral,
    such as keyboard, pointing devices, digital camera, printer, portable media players, 
    disk drives and network adapters to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power. 
    It has become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphone, PDAs and video game consoles. 
    USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interface, such as serial and parallel ports, 
    as well as separate power chargers for portable devices.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <li>	Firewire</li> 
    <div class="image-pictures">
        <img src="/images/firewire.jpg" alt="firewire photo">
    </div>
    <p>Technically know as the IEEE 1394 INTERFACE, but dubbed by Apple as firewire, 
    this connection medium hoped to surpass USB in term of speed and popularity. 
    While it did outperform USB v2 in speed test, uptake was very limited due to existing use of USB.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <li>	Parallel port</li>
    <div class="image-pictures">
        <img src="/images/parallel.jfif" alt="parallel photo">
    </div>
    <p>Parallel port are used to connect external hardware such as printers, 
    scanner or fax machines.
    While this technology is slowly being phased out in favour of USB, 
    parallel ports can still be found in many motherboards today.</p> 
    </div>

    <div>
    Thunderbolt 
    A recently developed port called Thunderbolt was released by intel. It’s expected to be strong competitor to USB, because it can transfer a larger amount of information at one time. 
    Ethernet 
    Ethernet ports are typically found on NICs. It’s a network port allowing data transfer from one computer to another.
    Some printers have network capabilities with ethernet ports.

    <h2>Definition of network</h2> 
    Providing an ability in a specified placed and time, is called “network “ in  better conditions, they provide an ability everywhere and at all times and its ideal: 
    In computer science this ability in computer network is data. The locations access to ability in network is called a “Node” 
    Why were network created?
    A “network” allows connected computers to share information and hardware. Imagine a business where there are many computer and a single printer. In this instance, the “network” allows each of the connected computers to access the printer at the same time, without changing the printer cable moving it from computer to computer.
    A “network” also allows connected computers to share files and data as well as hardware resources, i.e., scanners, plotters, projectors and storage devices, making it easier to collect and dispense information, and giving user the ability to collaborate. 

    <div>
    <ul>
    Different types of computer network exist to serve different needs;
    <li>Personal area network (PAN)</li>
    <li>Local area network (LAN)</li>
    <li>Metropolitan area network (MAN)</li>
    <li>Campus area network (CAN)</li>
    <li>Storage area network (SAN)</li>
    <li>Wide area network (WAN)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>THE INTERNET: is a “network” as well, and clearly the largest and most complex of all.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Types of common networks</h2> 
    <li>Local area network</li> (LAN) is created by a group of computer that are in close proximity to each other;
    hence local. The computer typically connect to each other by way of a router, which is advice that directs signals
    within the LAN. A network is a LAN that is created at school and businesses that have an exclusive network for students and employees. 
    A wi-fi hotspot, like the ones found at Starbucks, would also be a LAN. 

    <li>Wide area network</li> connect multiple LANs across large physical distances. They’re commonly created by leasing a wire from a cable company or internet provider, although WAN typically doesn’t require the internet in order to work . if the LAN of one school was connected to LAN at a school in another state, the two together would be a WAN. 
    THE INTERNET 
    The internet (integrated networks) is special collection of networks all interlinked together. It is made up of network called ISPs that interconnect the smaller LANs and WANs around it. There are multiple ISPs across the world, and all of these are connected, to create global network of networks.
    <li>Virtual private network</li> provide a special way to create a WAN by using the internet to connect LANs together, without leasing a private cable. An example might be if you house, away from school, you can create a VPN to connect to the schools network , having to lease a communications cable 
    Software
    Software enables computer hardware to perform specific task. Software, commonly know as programs or applications, consists of all the electronic instructions that tell the hardware how to perform a task. Software is capable of performing many different specific tasks, as opposed to hardware which only perform mechanical tasks that they are designed for.
    <p>There are three major types of software:</p>
    A.	Operating system software:
    Helps run computer hardware and computer system. Computer software includes the operating system, device drivers, diagnostic tools and more; the stuff that makes your computer useable by most people.
    The most commonly used operating systems software are:
    <li>Windows</li>
    <li>Mac OS X</li>
    <li>Linux</li>
</ul>
